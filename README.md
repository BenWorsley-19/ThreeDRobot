# 3D Robot

Webpage which displays a 3D robot hovering over a planet in space.

This is a bit fun I made off the back of deciding to do some learning around threejs and 3d models.
I developed the robot model myself in blender using blender kit's https://www.blenderkit.com/asset-gallery-detail/4cecc615-0b7c-437c-9368-c5fac59bc45d/ as a base to build off.
I used resources including https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery to learn about threejs.
